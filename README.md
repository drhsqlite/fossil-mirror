# About Fossil
Shago7932/Master
Fossil is a distributed version control system that has been widely
used since 2007.  Fossil was originally designed to support the
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org) project but has been adopted by many other
projects as well.

Fossil is self-hosting at <https://fossil-scm.org>.

If you are reading this on GitHub, then you are looking at a Git mirror
of the self-hosting Fossil repository.  The purpose of that mirror is to
test and exercise Fossil's ability to export a Git mirror.  Nobody much
uses the GitHub mirror, except to verify that the mirror logic works.  If
you want to know more about Fossil, visit the official self-hosting site
linked above.
