<title>Fossil Quick Start Guide</title>
<h1 align="center">Fossil Quick Start</h1>

<p>This is a guide to get you started using fossil quickly
and painlessly.</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>Fossil is a single self-contained C program.  You need to
    either download a
    <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html">precompiled
    binary</a>
    or <a href="build.wiki">compile it yourself</a> from sources.
    Install fossil by putting the fossil binary
    someplace on your $PATH.</p>

<a name="fslclone"></a>
<h2>General Work Flow</h2>

    <p>Fossil works with repository files (a database with the project's
    complete history) and with checked-out local trees (the working directory
    you use to do your work).
    (See [./whyusefossil.wiki#definitions | definitions] for more background.)
    The workflow looks like this:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create or clone a repository file.  ([/help/init|fossil init] or
            [/help/clone | fossil clone])
        <li>Check out a local tree.  ([/help/open | fossil open])
        <li>Perform operations on the repository (including repository
            configuration).
    </ul>

    <p>The following sections will give you a brief overview of these
    operations.</p>

<h2>Starting A New Project</h2>

    <p>To start a new project with fossil, create a new empty repository
    this way: ([/help/init | more info]) </p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil init </b><i> repository-filename</i>
    </blockquote>

<h2>Cloning An Existing Repository</h2>

    <p>Most fossil operations interact with a repository that is on the
    local disk drive, not on a remote system.  Hence, before accessing
    a remote repository it is necessary to make a local copy of that
    repository.  Making a local copy of a remote repository is called
    "cloning".</p>

    <p>Clone a remote repository as follows: ([/help/clone | more info])</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil clone</b> <i>URL  repository-filename</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <i>URL</i> specifies the fossil repository
    you want to clone.  The <i>repository-filename</i> is the new local
    filename into which the cloned repository will be written.  For
    example:

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil clone http://www.fossil-scm.org/ myclone.fossil</b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If the remote repository requires a login, include a
    userid in the URL like this:

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil clone http://</b><i>userid</i><b>@www.fossil-scm.org/ myclone.fossil</b>
    </blockquote>


    <p>You will be prompted separately for the password.
     Use "%HH" escapes for special characters in the userid.
     Examples: "%40" in place of "@" and "%2F" in place of "/".

    <p>If you are behind a restrictive firewall, you might need
    to <a href="#proxy">specify an HTTP proxy</a>.</p>

    <p>A Fossil repository is a single disk file.  Instead of cloning,
    you can just make a copy of the repository file (for example, using
    "scp").  Note, however, that the repository file contains auxiliary
    information above and beyond the versioned files, including some
    sensitive information such as password hashes and email addresses.  If you
    want to share Fossil repositories directly, consider running the
    [/help/scrub|fossil scrub] command to remove sensitive information
    before transmitting the file.

<h2>Importing From Another Version Control System</h2>

    <p>Rather than start a new project, or clone an existing Fossil project,
    you might prefer to
    <a href="./inout.wiki">import an existing Git project</a>
    into Fossil using the [/help/import | fossil import] command.

<h2>Checking Out A Local Tree</h2>

    <p>To work on a project in fossil, you need to check out a local
    copy of the source tree.  Create the directory you want to be
    the root of your tree and cd into that directory.  Then
    do this: ([/help/open | more info])</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil open </b><i> repository-filename</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This leaves you with the newest version of the tree
    checked out.
    From anywhere underneath the root of your local tree, you
    can type commands like the following to find out the status of
    your local tree:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/info | fossil info]</b><br>
    <b>[/help/status | fossil status]</b><br>
    <b>[/help/changes | fossil changes]</b><br>
    <b>[/help/diff | fossil diff]</b><br>
    <b>[/help/timeline | fossil timeline]</b><br>
    <b>[/help/ls | fossil ls]</b><br>
    <b>[/help/branch | fossil branch]</b><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Note that Fossil allows you to make multiple check-outs in
    separate directories from the same repository.  This enables you,
    for example, to do builds from multiple branches or versions at
    the same time without having to generate extra clones.</p>

    <p>To switch a checkout between different versions and branches,
    use:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/update | fossil update]</b><br>
    <b>[/help/checkout | fossil checkout]</b><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>[/help/update | update] honors the "autosync" option and
    does a "soft" switch, merging any local changes into the target
    version, whereas [/help/checkout | checkout] does not
    automatically sync and does a "hard" switch, overwriting local
    changes if told to do so.</p>

<h2>Configuring Your Local Repository</h2>

    <p>When you create a new repository, either by cloning an existing
    project or create a new project of your own, you usually want to do some
    local configuration.  This is easily accomplished using the web-server
    that is built into fossil.  Start the fossil webserver like this:
    ([/help/ui | more info])</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil ui </b><i> repository-filename</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You can omit the <i>repository-filename</i> from the command above
    if you are inside a checked-out local tree.</p>

    <p>This starts a web server then automatically launches your
    web browser and makes it point to this web server.  If your system
    has an unusual configuration, fossil might not be able to figure out
    how to start your web browser.  In that case, first tell fossil
    where to find your web browser using a command like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil setting web-browser </b><i>  path-to-web-browser</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>By default, fossil does not require a login for HTTP connections
    coming in from the IP loopback address 127.0.0.1.  You can, and perhaps
    should, change this after you create a few users.</p>

    <p>When you are finished configuring, just press Control-C or use
    the <b>kill</b> command to shut down the mini-server.</p>

<h2>Making Changes</h2>

    <p>To add new files to your project, or remove old files, use these
    commands:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/add | fossil add]</b> <i>file...</i><br>
    <b>[/help/rm | fossil rm]</b> <i>file...</i><br>
    <b>[/help/addremove | fossil addremove]</b> <i>file...</i><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You can also edit files freely.  Once you are ready to commit
    your changes, type:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/commit | fossil commit]</b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You will be prompted for check-in comments using whatever editor
    is specified by your VISUAL or EDITOR environment variable.</p>

    In the default configuration, the [/help/commit|commit]
    command will also automatically [/help/push|push] your changes, but that
    feature can be disabled.  (More information about
    [./concepts.wiki#workflow|autosync] and how to disable it.)
    Remember that your coworkers can not see your changes until you
    commit and push them.</p>

<h2>Sharing Changes</h2>

    <p>When [./concepts.wiki#workflow|autosync] is turned off,
    the changes you [/help/commit | commit] are only
    on your local repository.
    To share those changes with other repositories, do:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/push | fossil push]</b> <i>URL</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Where <i>URL</i> is the http: URL of the server repository you
    want to share your changes with.  If you omit the <i>URL</i> argument,
    fossil will use whatever server you most recently synced with.</p>

    <p>The [/help/push | push] command only sends your changes to others.  To
    Receive changes from others, use [/help/pull | pull].  Or go both ways at
    once using [/help/sync | sync]:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/pull | fossil pull]</b> <i>URL</i><br>
    <b>[/help/sync | fossil sync]</b> <i>URL</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When you pull in changes from others, they go into your repository,
    not into your checked-out local tree.  To get the changes into your
    local tree, use [/help/update | update]:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/update | fossil update]</b> <i>VERSION</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <i>VERSION</i> can be the name of a branch or tag or any
    abbreviation to the 40-character
    artifact identifier for a particular check-in, or it can be a
    date/time stamp.  ([./checkin_names.wiki | more info])
    If you omit
    the <i>VERSION</i>, then fossil moves you to the
    latest version of the branch your are currently on.</p>

    <p>The default behavior is for [./concepts.wiki#workflow|autosync] to
    be turned on.  That means that a [/help/pull|pull] automatically occurs
    when you run [/help/update|update] and a [/help/push|push] happens
    automatically after you [/help/commit|commit].  So in normal practice,
    the push, pull, and sync commands are rarely used.  But it is important
    to know about them, all the same.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/checkout | fossil checkout]</b> <i>VERSION</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Is similar to update except that it does not honor the autosync
    setting, nor does it merge in local changes - it prefers to overwrite
    them and fails if local changes exist unless the <tt>--force</tt>
    flag is used.</p>

<h2>Branching And Merging</h2>

    <p>Use the --branch option to the [/help/commit | commit] command
    to start a new branch.  Note that in Fossil, branches are normally
    created when you commit, not before you start editing.  You can
    use the [/help/branch | branch new] command to create a new branch
    before you start editing, if you want, but most people just wait
    until they are ready to commit.

    To merge two branches back together, first
    [/help/update | update] to the branch you want to merge into.
    Then do a [/help/merge|merge] of the other branch that you want to incorporate
    the changes from.  For example, to merge "featureX" changes into "trunk"
    do this:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil [/help/update|update] trunk</b><br>
    <b>fossil [/help/merge|merge] featureX</b><br>
    <i># make sure the merge didn't break anything...</i><br>
    <b>fossil [/help/commit|commit]
    </blockquote>

    <p>The argument to the [/help/merge|merge] command can be any of the
    version identifier forms that work for [/help/update|update].
    ([./checkin_names.wiki|more info].)
    The merge command has options to cherrypick individual
    changes, or to back out individual changes, if you don't want to
    do a full merge.</p>

    The merge command puts all changes in your working check-out.
    No changes are made to the repository.
    You must run [/help/commit|commit] separately
    to add the merge changes into your repository to make them persistent
    and so that your coworkers can see them.
    But before you do that, you will normally want to run a few tests
    to verify that the merge didn't cause logic breaks in your code.

    The same branch can be merged multiple times without trouble. Fossil
    automatically keeps up with things and avoids conflicts when doing
    multiple merges.  So even if you have merged the featureX branch
    into trunk previously, you can do so again and Fossil will automatically
    know to pull in only those changes that have occurred since the previous
    merge.

    <p>If a merge or update doesn't work out (perhaps something breaks or
    there are many merge conflicts) then you back up using:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/undo | fossil undo]</b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This will back out the changes that the merge or update made to the
    working checkout.  There is also a [/help/redo|redo] command if you undo by
    mistake.  Undo and redo only work for changes that have
    not yet been checked in using commit and there is only a single
    level of undo/redo.</p>


<h2>Setting Up A Server</h2>

    <p>Fossil can act as a stand-alone web server using one of these
    commands:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>[/help/server | fossil server]</b> <i>repository-filename</i><br>
    <b>[/help/ui | fossil ui]</b> <i>repository-filename</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <i>repository-filename</i> can be omitted when these commands
    are run from within an open check-out, which a particularly useful
    shortcut for the <b>fossil ui</b> command.

    <p>The <b>ui</b> command is intended for accessing the web interface
    from a local desktop.  The <b>ui</b> command binds to the loopback IP
    address only (and thus makes the web interface visible only on the
    local machine) and it automatically start your web browser pointing at the
    server.  For cross-machine collaboration, use the <b>server</b> command,
    which binds on all IP addresses and does not try to start a web browser.</p>

    <p>Servers are also easily configured as:
    <ul>
    <li>[./server.wiki#inetd|inetd/xinetd]
    <li>[./server.wiki#cgi|CGI]
    <li>[./server.wiki#scgi|SCGI]
    </ul>

    <p>The [./selfhost.wiki | self-hosting fossil repositories] use
    CGI.

<a name="proxy"></a>
<h2>HTTP Proxies</h2>

    <p>If you are behind a restrictive firewall that requires you to use
    an HTTP proxy to reach the internet, then you can configure the proxy
    in three different ways.  You can tell fossil about your proxy using
    a command-line option on commands that use the network,
    <b>sync</b>, <b>clone</b>, <b>push</b>, and <b>pull</b>.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil clone </b><i>URL</i>  <b>--proxy</b> <i>Proxy-URL</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is annoying to have to type in the proxy URL every time you
    sync your project, though, so you can make the proxy configuration
    persistent using the [/help/setting | setting] command:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil setting proxy </b><i>Proxy-URL</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Or, you can set the "<b>http_proxy</b>" environment variable:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>export http_proxy=</b><i>Proxy-URL</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To stop using the proxy, do:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil setting proxy off</b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Or unset the environment variable.  The fossil setting for the
    HTTP proxy takes precedence over the environment variable and the
    command-line option overrides both.  If you have an persistent
    proxy setting that you want to override for a one-time sync, that
    is easily done on the command-line.  For example, to sync with
    a co-workers repository on your LAN, you might type:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>fossil sync http://192.168.1.36:8080/ --proxy off</b>
    </blockquote>

<h2>More Hints</h2>

    <p>A [/help | complete list of commands] is available, as is the
    [./hints.wiki|helpful hints] document.  See the
    [./permutedindex.html#pindex|permuted index] for additional
    documentation.
