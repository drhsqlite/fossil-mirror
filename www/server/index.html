<h2>No Server Required</h2>

<p>Fossil does not require a central server, but <a
href="whyuseaserver.wiki">a server can be useful</a>.</p>

<p>A Fossil server does not require much memory, CPU, or disk space
and can run comfortably on a generic $5/month virtual host 
or on a small device like a Raspberry Pi, or it can co-exist 
on a host running other services without getting in the way.

<p>This article is a quick-reference guide for setting up your own
Fossil server, with links to more detailed instructions specific to
particular systems, should you want extra help.</p>


<h2 id="prep">Repository Prep</h2>

<p>Prior to serving a Fossil repository to others, consider running <a
href="$ROOT/help/ui"><tt>fossil ui</tt></a> locally and taking these
minimum recommended preparation steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Fossil creates only one user in a <a
  href="$ROOT/help/new">new repository</a> and gives it the <a
  href="../caps/admin-v-setup.md#apsu">all-powerful Setup capability</a>.
  The 10-digit random password generated for that user is fairly strong
  against remote attack, even without explicit password guess rate
  limiting, but because that user has so much power, you may want to
  give it a much stronger password under Admin → Users.</a></li>

  <li><p>Run the Admin → Security-Audit tool to verify that other
  security-related permissions and settings are as you want them.
  Consider clicking the “Take it private” link on that page to lock down
  the security on that site to a level appropriate to a private
  repository, even if you will eventually want some public service. It's
  better to start from a secure position and open up service
  feature-by-feature as necessary than it is to start from a fully open
  position and lock down features one by one to achieve a secure
  stance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With the repository secured, it is safe to upload a copy of the
repository file to your server and proceed with server setup, below.
Further configuration steps can wait until <a href="#postsetup">after
the server is running</a>.</p>


<h2 id="methods">Activation Methods</h2>

<p>There are basically five ways to run a Fossil server:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="any/cgi.md">CGI</a>
  <li><a href="#slist">Socket listener</a>
  <li><a href="any/none.md">Stand-alone HTTP server</a>
  <li><a href="any/scgi.md">SCGI</a>
  <li><a href="#ssh">SSH</a>
</ol>

<p>All of these methods can serve either a single repository or a
directory hierarchy containing multiple repositories.</p>

<p>You are not restricted to a single server setup. The same Fossil
repository can be served using two or more of the above techniques at
the same time. These methods use clean, well-defined, standard
interfaces (CGI, SCGI, and HTTP) which allow you to easily migrate from
one method to another in response to changes in hosting providers or
administrator preferences.</p>

<h3 id="cgi">CGI</h3>

<p>Most ordinary web servers can <a href="any/cgi.md">run Fossil as a
CGI script</a>. This method is known to work with Apache,
<tt>lighttpd</tt>, and <a
href="any/althttpd.md"><tt>althttpd</tt></a>.  The Fossil server
administrator places a <a href="$ROOT/help/cgi">short CGI script</a> in
the web server's document hierarchy and when a client requests the URL
that corresponds to that script, Fossil runs and generates the
response.</p>

<p>CGI is a good choice for merging Fossil into an existing web site,
particularly on hosts that have CGI set up and working.
The Fossil <a href="../selfhost.wiki">self-hosting repositories</a> are
implemented with CGI underneath <tt>althttpd</tt>.</p>

<h3 id="slist">Socket Listener</h3>

<p>Socket listener daemons such as
<a id="inetd" href="any/inetd.md"><tt>inetd</tt></a>, <a id="xinetd"
href="any/xinetd.md"><tt>xinetd</tt></a>, <a id="stunnel"
href="any/stunnel.md"><tt>stunnel</tt></a>, <a
href="macos/service.md"><tt>launchd</tt></a>, and <a
href="debian/service.md"><tt>systemd</tt></a>
can be configured to invoke the the
<a href="$ROOT/help/http"><tt>fossil http</tt></a> command to handle
each incoming HTTP request.  The "<tt>fossil http</tt>" command reads
the HTTP request off of standard input, computes an appropriate
reply, and writes the reply on standard output.  There is a separate
invocation of the "<tt>fossil http</tt>" command for each HTTP request.
The socket listener daemon takes care of relaying content to and from
the client, and (in the case of <a href="any/stunnel.md">stunnel</a>) 
handling TLS decryption and encryption.

<h3 id="standalone">Stand-alone HTTP Server</h3>

<p>This is the <a href="any/none.md">easiest method</a>.
A stand-alone server uses the
<a href="$ROOT/help/server"><tt>fossil server</tt></a> command to run a
process that listens for incoming HTTP requests on a socket and then
dispatches a copy of itself to deal with each incoming request. You can
expose Fossil directly to the clients in this way or you can interpose a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a>
layer between the clients and Fossil.</p>

<h3 id="scgi">SCGI</h3>

<p>The Fossil standalone server can also handle <a href="any/scgi.md">SCGI</a>.
When the <a href="$ROOT/help/server"><tt>fossil server</tt></a> command is
run with the extra <tt>--scgi</tt> option, it listens for incoming
SCGI requests rather than HTTP requests. This allows Fossil to
respond to requests from web servers <a href="debian/nginx.md">such as
nginx</a> that don't support CGI. SCGI is a simpler protocol to proxy
than HTTP, since the HTTP doesn't have to be re-interpreted in terms of
the proxy's existing HTTP implementation, but it's more complex to set
up because you also have to set up an SCGI-to-HTTP proxy for it. It is
worth taking on this difficulty only when you need to integrate Fossil
into an existing web site already being served by an SCGI-capable web
server.</p>

<h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3>

<p>Fossil supports <tt>ssh://</tt> URLs, but there are <a
href="../caps/#webonly">practical limitations</a> with the default
behavior. You can get the full power of <a href="../caps/">Fossil's RBAC
system</a> over SSH <a href="any/http-over-ssh.md">with a bit of clever
configuration</a>.</p>

<h2 id="matrix">Activation Tutorials</h2>

<p>We've broken the configuration for each method out into a series of
sub-articles. Some of these are generic, while others depend on
particular operating systems or front-end software:</p>

<p>Where there is a check mark in the "<b>Any</b>" row, the method for that is
generic enough that it works across OSes that Fossil is known to work
on. The check marks below that usually just link to this generic
documentation.</p>

<p>The method in the "<b>proxy</b>" column is for the platform's default
web server configured as a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a> for
Fossil's built-in HTTP server: <a href="debian/nginx.md">nginx</a>, <a

<h2 id="postsetup">Post-Activation Configuration</h2>

<p>After the server is up and running, log into it as the Setup user and
visit the Admin menu to finish configuring that repository for
service:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Add user accounts for your other team members. Use <a
  href="../caps/index.md#ucat">categories</a> to define access policies
  rather than redundantly give each new user the same <a
  href="../caps/index.md#ucap">individual capabilities</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Test access to the repository from each category of non-Setup
  user that you created. You may have to give your user categories some
  overlooked capabilities, particularly if you followed <a
  href="#prep">our earlier advice</a> to take the repository private
  prior to setting up the server.</p></li>

  <li><p>Modify the repository's look and feel by <a
  href="../customskin.md">customizing the skin</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>If the repository includes <a
  href="../embeddeddoc.wiki">embedded documentation</a>, consider
  activating the search feature (Admin → Search) so that visitors can do
  full-text search on your documentation.</p></li>

  <li><p>Now that others can be making changes to the repository,
  consider monitoring them via <a href="../alerts.md">email alerts</a>
  or the <a href="$ROOT/help/www/timeline.rss">timeline RSS
  feed</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Turn on the various logging features.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Reload the Admin → Security-Audit page occasionally during this
process to double check that you have not mistakenly configured the
server in a way that might expose information that you want to keep
private.</p>
