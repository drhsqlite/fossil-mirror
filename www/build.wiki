<title>Compiling and Installing Fossil</title>

<h2>0.0 Using A Pre-compiled Binary</h2>

<p>[/uv/download.html|Pre-compiled binaries] are available for recent
releases. Just download
the appropriate executable for your platform
and put it on your $PATH.
To uninstall, simply delete the executable.
To upgrade from an older release, just overwrite the older binary with
the newer one.</p>

<h2>0.1 Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Building and installing is very simple.  Three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Download and unpack a source tarball or ZIP.
<li> <b>./configure; make</b>
<li> Move the resulting "fossil" or "fossil.exe" executable to someplace on
your $PATH.
</ol>

<p><hr>

<h2>1.0 Obtaining The Source Code</h2>

<p>Fossil is self-hosting, so you can obtain a ZIP archive or tarball
containing a snapshot of the <em>latest</em> version directly from
Fossil's own fossil repository. Additionally, source archives of
<em>released</em> versions of
fossil are available from the [/uv/download.html|downloads page].
To obtain a development version of fossil, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Point your web browser to [https://www.fossil-scm.org/]</li>

<li><p>Click on the [/timeline|Timeline]
link at the top of the page.</p></li>

<li><p>Select a version of of Fossil you want to download.  The latest
version on the trunk branch is usually a good choice.  Click on its
link.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, click on one of the
"Zip Archive" or "Tarball" links, according to your preference.
These link will build a ZIP archive or a gzip-compressed tarball of the
complete source code and download it to your computer.
</ol>

<h2>Aside: Is it really safe to use an unreleased development version of
the Fossil source code?</h2>

Yes!  Any check-in on the
[/timeline?t=trunk | trunk branch] of the Fossil
[http://fossil-scm.org/fossil/timeline | Fossil self-hosting repository]
will work fine.  (Dodgy code is always on a branch.)  In the unlikely
event that you pick a version with a serious bug, it still won't
clobber your files.  Fossil uses several
[./selfcheck.wiki | self-checks] prior to committing any
repository change that prevent loss-of-work due to bugs.

The Fossil [./selfhost.wiki | self-hosting repositories], especially
the one at [http://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil], usually run a version
of trunk that is less than a week or two old.  Look at the bottom
left-hand corner of this screen (to the right of "This page was
generated in...") to see exactly which version of Fossil is
rendering this page.  It is always safe to use whatever version
of the Fossil code you find running on the main Fossil website.

<h2>2.0 Compiling</h2>

<ol>
<li value="5">
<p>Unpack the ZIP or tarball you downloaded then
<b>cd</b> into the directory created.</p></li>

<li><i>(Optional, Debian-compatible Linux only)</i>
Make sure you have all the necessary tools and libraries at hand by running:
<b>sudo apt install tcl-dev tk libssl-dev</b>.

<li><i>(Optional, Unix only)</i>
Run <b>./configure</b> to construct a makefile.

<ol type="a">
<li><p>
The build system for Fossil on Unix-like systems assumes that the
OpenSSL development and runtime files are available on your system,
because unprotected repositories are trivial to attack otherwise.
Indeed, some public Fossil repositories — including Fossil's own — today
run in an HTTPS-only mode, so that you can't even do an anonymous clone
from them without using the TLS features added to Fossil by OpenSSL. To
weaken that stance could allow a
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack|man in the
middle attack], such as one that substitutes malicious code into your
Fossil repository clone.</p>

<p>You can force the Fossil build system to avoid searching for, building
against, and linking to the OpenSSL library by passing
<b>--with-openssl=none</b> to the <tt>configure</tt> script.</p>

<p>If you do not have the OpenSSL development libraries on your system,
we recommend that you install them, typically via your OS's package
manager. The Fossil build system goes to a lot of effort to seek these
out wherever they may be found, so that is typically all you need to
do.</p>

<p>For more advanced use cases, see the [./ssl.wiki#openssl-bin|OpenSSL
discussion in the "TLS and Fossil" document].</p>

<li><p>
To build a statically linked binary (suitable for use inside a chroot
jail) add the <b>--static</b> option.

<li><p>
To enable the native [./th1.md#tclEval | Tcl integration feature] feature,
add the <b>--with-tcl=1</b> and <b>--with-tcl-private-stubs=1</b> options.

<li><p>
Other configuration options can be seen by running
<b>./configure --help</b>
</ol>

<li><p>Run "<b>make</b>" to build the "fossil" or "fossil.exe" executable.
The details depend on your platform and compiler.

<ol type="a">
<li><p><i>Unix</i> → the configure-generated Makefile should work on
all Unix and Unix-like systems.  Simply type "<b>make</b>".

<li><p><i>Unix without running "configure"</i> → if you prefer to avoid
running configure, you can also use: <b>make -f Makefile.classic</b>.  You may
want to make minor edits to Makefile.classic to configure the build for your
system.

<li><p><i>MinGW 3.x (<u>not</u> 4.x) / MinGW-w64</i> → Use the MinGW makefile:
"<b>make -f win/Makefile.mingw</b>".  On a Windows box you will need either
Cygwin or MSYS as build environment. On Cygwin, Linux or Darwin you may want
to make minor edits to win/Makefile.mingw to configure the cross-compile
environment.

To enable the native [./th1.md#tclEval | Tcl integration feature], use a
command line like the following (all on one line):

<b>make -f win/Makefile.mingw FOSSIL_ENABLE_TCL=1 FOSSIL_ENABLE_TCL_STUBS=1 FOSSIL_ENABLE_TCL_PRIVATE_STUBS=1</b>

Alternatively, <b>./configure</b> may now be used to create a Makefile
suitable for use with MinGW; however, options passed to configure that are
not applicable on Windows may cause the configuration or compilation to fail
(e.g. fusefs, internal-sqlite, etc).

<i>HINT</i>: Do <u>not</u> use MinGW-4.x, it may compile but the Fossil binary
will not work correctly, see
[https://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/tktview/18cff45a4e210430e24c | ticket].

<li><p><i>MSVC</i> → Use the MSVC makefile.  First
change to the "win/" subdirectory ("<b>cd win</b>") then run
"<b>nmake /f Makefile.msc</b>".<br><br>Alternatively, the batch
file "<b>win\buildmsvc.bat</b>" may be used and it will attempt to
detect and use the latest installed version of MSVC.<br><br>To enable
the optional <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> support,
first <a href="https://www.openssl.org/source/">download the official
source code for OpenSSL</a> and extract it to an appropriately named
"<b>openssl-X.Y.ZA</b>" subdirectory within the local
[/tree?ci=trunk&name=compat | compat] directory (e.g.
"<b>compat/openssl-1.1.1f</b>"), then make sure that some recent
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> binaries are installed locally,
and finally run one of the following commands:
<blockquote><pre>
nmake /f Makefile.msc FOSSIL_ENABLE_SSL=1 FOSSIL_BUILD_SSL=1 PERLDIR=C:\full\path\to\Perl\bin
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote><pre>
buildmsvc.bat FOSSIL_ENABLE_SSL=1 FOSSIL_BUILD_SSL=1 PERLDIR=C:\full\path\to\Perl\bin
</pre></blockquote>
To enable the optional native [./th1.md#tclEval | Tcl integration feature],
run one of the following commands or add the &quot;FOSSIL_ENABLE_TCL=1&quot;
argument to one of the other NMAKE command lines:
<blockquote><pre>
nmake /f Makefile.msc FOSSIL_ENABLE_TCL=1
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote><pre>
buildmsvc.bat FOSSIL_ENABLE_TCL=1
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p><i>Cygwin</i> → The same as other Unix-like systems. It is
recommended to configure using: "<b>configure --disable-internal-sqlite</b>",
making sure you have the "libsqlite3-devel" , "zlib-devel" and
"openssl-devel" packages installed first.
</ol>
</ol>

<h2>3.0 Installing</h2>

<ol>
<li value="9">
<p>The finished binary is named "fossil" (or "fossil.exe" on Windows).
Put this binary in a
directory that is somewhere on your PATH environment variable.
It does not matter where.</p>

<li>
<p><b>(Optional:)</b>
To uninstall, just delete the binary.</p>
</ol>

<h2>4.0 Additional Considerations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
  If the makefiles that come with Fossil do not work for
  you, or for some other reason you want to know how to build
  Fossil manually, then refer to the
  [./makefile.wiki | Fossil Build Process] document which describes
  in detail what the makefiles do behind the scenes.

<li><p>
  The fossil executable is self-contained and stand-alone and usually
  requires no special libraries or other software to be installed.  However,
  the "--tk" option to the [/help/diff|diff command] requires that Tcl/Tk
  be installed on the local machine.  You can get Tcl/Tk from
  [http://www.activestate.com/activetcl|ActiveState].

<li><p>
  To build on older Macs (circa 2002, MacOS 10.2) edit the Makefile
  generated by configure to add the following lines:
  <blockquote><pre>
  TCC += -DSQLITE_WITHOUT_ZONEMALLOC
  TCC += -D_BSD_SOURCE
  TCC += -DWITHOUT_ICONV
  TCC += -Dsocketlen_t=int
  TCC += -DSQLITE_MAX_MMAP_SIZE=0
</pre></blockquote>
</ul>

<h2>5.0 Building a Static Binary on Linux using Docker</h2>

Building a static binary on Linux is not as straightforward as it
could be because the GNU C library requires that certain components be
dynamically loadable. That can be worked around by building against a
different C library, which is simplest to do by way of a container
environment like [https://www.docker.com/ | Docker].

The following instructions for building fossil using Docker
were adapted from [https://fossil-scm.org/forum/forumpost/5dd2d61e5f | forumpost/5dd2d61e5f].
These instructions assume that docker is installed and that the user running
these instructions has permission to do so (i.e., they are <tt>root</tt> or
are a member of the <tt>docker</tt> group).

First, create a file named <tt>Dockerfile</tt> with the following contents:

<pre><code>

RUN     apk update                                                                                      \
        && apk upgrade                                                                                  \
                                                                                                        \
        && apk add --no-cache                                                                           \
        curl gcc make tcl                                                                               \

                                                                                                        \
        && tar xf fossil-src.tar.gz                                                                     \
        && cd fossil-src                                                                                \
                                                                                                        \
        && ./configure                                                                                  \
        --static                                                                                        \
        --disable-fusefs                                                                                \
        --with-th1-docs                                                                                 \
        --with-th1-hooks                                                                                \
                                                                                                        \
        && make
</code></pre>

Be sure to modify the <tt>configure</tt> flags, if desired. e.g., add <tt>--json</tt>
for JSON support.

From the directory containing that file, build it with docker:

<pre><code># docker build -t fossil_static .</code></pre>

If you get permissions errors when running that as a non-root user,
be sure to add the user to the <tt>docker</tt> group before trying
again.

That creates a docker image and builds a static fossil binary inside
it. That step will take several minutes or more, depending on the
speed of the build environment.

Next, create a docker container to host the image we just created:

<pre><code># docker create --name fossil fossil_static</code></pre>

Then copy the fossil binary from that container:

<pre><code># docker cp fossil:/fossil-src/fossil fossil</code></pre>

The resulting binary will be <em>huge</em> because it is built with
debug info. To strip that information, reducing the size greatly:

<pre><code># strip fossil</code></pre>

To delete the Docker container and image (if desired), run:

<pre><code># docker container rm fossil
# docker image ls
</code></pre>

Note the IDs of the images named <tt>fossil_static</tt> and <tt>alpine</tt>, then:

<pre><code>docker image rm THE_FOSSIL_ID THE_ALPINE_ID</code></pre>


<h2>6.0 Building on/for Android</h2>

<h3>6.1 Cross-compiling from Linux</h3>

The following instructions for building Fossil for Andoid,
without requiring a rooted OS, are adapted from
[https://fossil-scm.org/forum/forumpost/e0e9de4a7e | forumpost/e0e9de4a7e].

On the development machine, from the fossil source tree:

<pre><code>export CC=$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/armv7a-linux-androideabi21-clang
./configure --with-openssl=none
make
</code></pre>


On the Android device, enable the <em>USB debugging</em> option from
Developer menu in Device Options. Connect the device to the development
system with USB. If it's configured and connected properly,
the device should show up in the output of <code>adb devices</code>:

<pre><code>sudo adb devices
</code></pre>

Copy the resulting fossil binary onto the device...

<pre><code>sudo adb push fossil /data/local/tmp
</code></pre>

And run it from an <code>adb</code> shell:

<pre><code>sudo adb shell
&gt; cd /data/local/tmp
# Fossil requires a HOME directory to work with:
&gt; export HOME=$PWD
&gt; export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
&gt; fossil version
This is fossil version 2.11 &#91;e5653a4ceb] 2020-03-26 18:54:02 UTC
</code></pre>

The output might, or might not, include warnings such as:

<pre><code>WARNING: linker: ./fossil: unused DT entry: type 0x6ffffef5 arg 0x1464
WARNING: linker: ./fossil: unused DT entry: type 0x6ffffffe arg 0x1ba8
WARNING: linker: ./fossil: unused DT entry: type 0x6fffffff arg 0x2
</code></pre>

The source of such warnings is not 100% certain.
Some information about these (reportedly harmless) warnings can
be found
