** COMMAND: undo

**  * fossil update
**  * fossil merge
**  * fossil revert
**  * fossil stash pop
**  * fossil stash apply
**  * fossil stash drop
**  * fossil stash goto
**  * fossil clean (*see note below*)
**
** Note: The "fossil clean" command only saves state for files less than
** 10MiB in size and so if fossil clean deleted files larger than that,
** then "fossil undo" will not recover the larger files.
**
** If FILENAME is specified then restore the content of the named
** file(s) but otherwise leave the update or merge or revert in effect.
** The redo command undoes the effect of the most recent undo.
**
** If the -n|--dry-run option is present, no changes are made and instead
** the undo or redo command explains what actions the undo or redo would
** have done had the -n|--dry-run been omitted.
**
** If the most recent command is not one of those listed as undoable,
** then the undo command might try to restore the state to be what it was
** prior to the last undoable command, or it might be a no-op.  If in
** doubt about what the undo command will do, first run it with the -n
** option.
**
** A single level of undo/redo is supported.  The undo/redo stack
** is cleared by the commit and check-out commands.  Other commands may
** or may not clear the undo stack.
**
** Future versions of Fossil might add new commands to the set of commands
** that are undoable.

**   -n|--dry-run   Do not make changes, but show what would be done
