<h2>status</h2>

The <code>status</code> command is informational, it doesn't do anything to
a checked-out project, but it tells you something about it.

Running <code>&nbsp;fossil&nbsp;status&nbsp;</code> currently prefixes
the output of the <code>[./cmd_changes.wiki | changes]</code> command
with information about the repository and checkout.  The information
is in the form of the [./concepts.wiki#aidex | Artifact ID]s of the
server code, the checkout, and the parent (of, I <em>think</em> the
checkout.)

This is useful for getting an at-a-glance view of the state of your
project, especially in a situation where you need the artifact IDs.

Here is what I get when I issue a <code>status</code> on my local
version of the <b>fossil</b> repository as I write this:

<nowiki><pre>
   $ fossil status
   repository:   /home/me/myclone.fossil
   local-root:   /home/me/fossil/
   server-code:  99d6c9cf3f262720579db177503812814d712fc7
   checkout:     a8c3a7ea9249281e0a1fb55fb31d2ad57844f848
   parent:       21cecd209f7201f17e8a784c0d8f735603d440ae
   EDITED   www/cmd_.wiki-template
   EDITED   www/cmd_add.wiki
   EDITED   www/cmd_all.wiki
   EDITED   www/cmd_extra.wiki
   EDITED   www/cmd_ls.wiki
   EDITED   www/cmd_update.wiki
   EDITED   www/index.wiki
   $
</pre></nowiki>

Once I actually make changes to the repository (say, a
[./cmd_commit.wiki | commit]) most of that will change—all
of those files showing as "EDITED" will be checked in and won't
show up, and the artifact IDs will reflect the new state of the
repository.

If the only thing you want to see is which files in the checked-out
source tree have changed in some way, use the
[./cmd_changes.wiki | <code>changes</code>] command.

If what you want is the files in the checked-out source tree which are
<em>not</em> part of the project, use the
[./cmd_extra.wiki | <code>extra</code>] command.
