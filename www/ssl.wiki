<title>TLS and Fossil</title>

<h2>Using TLS-Encrypted Communications with Fossil</h2>

If you are storing sensitive information in a repository accessible over
a network whose integrity you do not fully trust, you should use TLS to
encrypt all communications with it. This is most true for repositories
accessed over the Internet, especially if they will be accessed from
edge networks you do not control, since that admits of various forms of
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack|man in the
middle attack].

TLS protects the credentials used to access the server, prevents
eavesdropping, prevents in-flight data modification, prevents server
identify spoofing, and more.

There are two major aspects to this, both of which have to be addressed
in different ways. Those are the subjects of the next two major
sections.


<h2 id="client">Fossil TLS Configuration: Client Side</h2>

Fossil itself has built-in support for TLS on the client side only. That
is to say, you can build it against [https://www.openssl.org/|the
OpenSSL library], which will allow it to clone and sync with a remote
Fossil repository via <tt>https</tt> URIs.


<h3 id="openssl-bin">Building Against a Binary Version of OpenSSL</h3>

The <tt>configure</tt> script will attempt to find OpenSSL on your
system automatically. If it can't find the files it needs, the most
common solution is to install the OpenSSL development package on your
system via your OS's package manager. Examples:

  *  <b>RHEL & Fedora</b>: <tt>sudo yum install openssl-devel</tt>
  *  <b>Debian & Ubuntu</b>: <tt>sudo apt install libssl-dev</tt>
  *  <b>FreeBSD</b>: <tt>su -c 'pkg install openssl'</tt>
  *  <b>macOS</b>: <tt>sudo brew install openssl</tt>
  *  <b>Cygwin</b>: Install <tt>openssl-devel</tt> via Cygwin's
     <tt>setup-*.exe</tt> program

The macOS case requires explanation. Apple last shipped OpenSSL
develpoment files in OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), choosing to deprecate it
from that point forward. (Apple wants you to use their proprietary
platform-specific encryption methods instead.) Since macOS has no
built-in package manager, a number have sprung up out of the FOSS world.
It is not known to this author whether Fossil's current build system can
find OpenSSL as installed with any of these other package managers, so
unless you have a particular reason to avoid it, we recomend that you
use [https://brew.sh|Homebrew] on macOS to install OpenSSL as above.
Fossil's build system will seek it out and use it automatically.


<h3 id="openssl-src">Building Against a Non-Platform Version of
OpenSSL</h3>

The Fossil build system can also find and use OpenSSL in nonstandard
locations.

If you've installed OpenSSL via a method that Fossil's build system
cannot find on its own, you can clue it in by passing the
<tt>--with-openssl</tt> option to the <tt>configure</tt> script. Type
<tt>./configure --help</tt> for details.

Even if the Fossil build system does manage to find a workable version
of OpenSSL, it is possible that the platform version is outdated in some
key way, enough so that you do not want to use it with Fossil. (The
chance of this happening increases as your OS ages.) For example, the
platform version of OpenSSL might not support any of the
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_suite|cipher suites] the remote
Fossil repository's HTTPS proxy is willing to offer, so that even though
both sides are speaking a variant of TLS/SSL, they can't come to an
agreement on the cryptography.  In such cases, you may want to link
Fossil to a newer version of OpenSSL than the one available in your OS's
package repository. You can do this like so, from the root of the Fossil
source tree:

<pre>
    cd compat
    tar xf /path/to/openssl-*.tar.gz
    ln -fs openssl-x.y.z openssl
    ./config              # or, e.g. ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc
    make -j11
    cd ../..
    ./configure --with-openssl=tree
    make -j11
</pre>

That will get you a Fossil binary statically linked to this in-tree
version of OpenSSL.

Beware, taking this path typically opens you up to new problems, which
are conveniently covered in the next section!


<h3 id="certs">Certificates</h3>

To verify the identify of a server, TLS uses
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Certificates|X.509 certificates].

If you are using a self-signed certificate, you'll be asked if you want
to accept the certificate the first time you communicate with the
server. Verify the certificate fingerprint is correct, then answer
"always" to remember your decision.

If you are cloning from or syncing to Fossil servers that use a
certificate signed by a
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority|certificate
authority] (CA), Fossil needs to know which CAs you trust to sign those
certificates. Fossil relies on the OpenSSL library to have some way to
check a trusted list of CA signing keys.

There are two common ways this fails:

  #  <p>The OpenSSL library Fossil is linked to doesn't have a CA
     signing key set at all, so that it initially trusts no certificates
     at all.</p>
  #  <p>The OpenSSL library does have a CA cert set, but your Fossil server's
     TLS certificate was signed by a CA that isn't in that set.</p>

A common reason to fall into the second trap is that you're using
certificates signed by a local private CA, as often happens in large
enterprises.  You can solve this sort of problem by getting your local
CA's signing certificate in PEM format and pointing OpenSSL at it:

<pre>
     fossil set --global ssl-ca-location /path/to/local-ca.pem
</pre>

The use of <tt>--global</tt> with this option is common, since you may
have multiple reposotories served under certificates signed by that same
CA.

A common way to run into the broader first problem is that you're on
FreeBSD, which does not install a CA certificate set by default, even as
a dependency of the OpenSSL library.  If you're using a certificate
signed by one of the major public CAs, you can solve this by installing
the <tt>ca_root_nss</tt> package. That package contains the Mozilla NSS
certificate bundle, which gets installed in a location that OpenSSL
checks by default, so you don't need to change any Fossil settings.
(This is the same certificate set that ships with Firefox, by the way.)

The same sort of thing happens with the Windows build of OpenSSL, but
for a different core reason: Windows does ship with a stock CA
certificate set, but it's not in a format that OpenSSL understands how
to use.  Rather than try to find a way to convert the data format, you
may find it acceptable to use the same Mozilla NSS cert set.  I do not
know of a way to easily get this from Mozilla themselves, but I did find
a [https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html|third party source] for the
<tt>cacert.pem</tt> file. Install it somewhere on your system, then
point Fossil at it like so:

<pre>
     fossil set --global ssl-ca-location /path/to/cacert.pem
</pre>

Linux platforms tend to provide such a root cert store along with the
platform OpenSSL package, either built-in or as a hard dependency.


<h4>Client-Side Certificates</h4>

You can also use client side certificates to add an extra layer of
authentication, over and above Fossil's built in user management. If you
are particularly paranoid, you'll want to use this to remove the ability
of anyone on the internet from making any request to Fossil. Without
presenting a valid client side certificate, the web server won't invoke
the Fossil CGI handler.

Configure your server to request a client side certificate, and set up a
certificate authority to sign your client certificates. For each person
who needs to access the repository, create a private key and certificate
signed with that CA.

The PEM encoded private key and certificate should be stored in a single
file, simply by concatenating the key and certificate files. Specify the
location of this file with the <tt>ssl-identity</tt> setting, or the
<tt>--ssl-identity</tt> option to the <tt>clone</tt> command.

If you've password protected the private key, the password will be
requested every time you connect to the server. This password is not
stored by fossil, as doing so would defeat the purpose of having a
password.

If you attempt to connect to a server which requests a client
certificate, but don't provide one, fossil will show an error message
which explains what to do to authenticate with the server.


<h2 id="server">Fossil TLS Configuration: Server Side</h2>

Fossil's built-in HTTP server feature does not currently have a built-in
way to serve via HTTP over TLS, a.k.a. HTTPS, even when you've linked
Fossil to OpenSSL. To serve a Fossil repository via HTTPS, you must put
it behind some kind of HTTPS proxy.


<h3 id="stunnel">stunnel Alone</h3>

Conceptually, the simplest option is to [https://www.stunnel.org/|set up
stunnel].  A typical configuration is to run Fossil as an HTTP server
bound to localhost only, then export access to it via HTTPS with stunnel
encrypting access to Fossil instance hiding behind it.

The difficulty comes in configuring it, which really wants a guide that
no one has written for us yet. Until that appears, you'll have to read
the stunnel documentation and that of your TLS certificate provider to
work out how to set this up.


<h3 id="althttpd">stunnel + althttpd</h3>

The public SQLite and Fossil web sites can't just use stunnel + Fossil
because parts of the web site are static, served by
[https://www.sqlite.org/docsrc/file/misc/althttpd.c|a separate web
server called <tt>althttpd</tt>], written by the primary author of both
SQLite and Fossil. It is a lightweight HTTP-only web server. It handles
the static HTTP hits on <tt>sqlite.org</tt> and <tt>fossil-scm.org</tt>,
delegating HTTPS and dynamic Fossil content hits to stunnel and Fossil.

The only documentation for althttpd currently is in its header comment.
As is typical for drh software, althttpd is a single-file C program, so
that at worst, you just have to read its code to understand it.


<h3 id="nginx">nginx</h3>

If your needs are more complex than althttpd can handle or you'd prefer
to use only software available in your server operating system's package
repository, we recommend that you step up to [http://nginx.org/|nginx].
Setting this up is complex enough that we cover it [./tls-nginx.md|in a
separate document].


<h2 id="enforcing">Enforcing TLS Access</h2>

To use TLS encryption in cloning and syncing to a remote Fossil
repository, be sure to use the <tt>https:</tt> URI scheme in
<tt>clone</tt> and <tt>sync</tt> commands.  If your server is configured
to serve the repository via both HTTP and HTTPS, it's easy to
accidentally use unencrypted HTTP if you forget the all-important 's'.

As of Fossil 2.8, there is a setting in the Fossil UI under Admin &rarr;
Access called "Redirect to HTTPS," which is set to "Off" by default.
Changing this only affects web UI access to the Fossil repository. It
doesn't affect clones and syncs done via the <tt>http</tt> URI scheme.

In Fossil 2.7 and earlier, there was a much weaker form of this setting
affecting the <tt>/login</tt> page only. If you're using this setting,
you should migrate to the new setting as soon as possible, because the
old setting allows multiple ways of defeating it.

<b id="rloop">WARNING:</b> Enabling HTTPS redirects at the Fossil repo
level while running Fossil behind an HTTPS proxy can result in an
infinite redirect loop.  It happens when the proxy mechanism presents
"<tt>http</tt>" URIs to Fossil, so Fossil issues a redirect, so the browser
fetches the page again, causing Fossil to see an "<tt>http</tt>" URI again, so
it issues a redirect...'round and 'round it goes until the web browser
detects it's in a redirect loop and gives up. This problem prevents you
from getting back into the Admin UI to fix it, but there are several
ways to fix it:

  #  <p><b>Reset via CLI.</b> You can turn the setting back off from the
     CLI with the command "<tt>fossil -R /path/to/repo.fossil set
     redirect-to-https 0</tt>". (Currently doesn't work.)</p>
  #  <p><b>Backup first.</b> This setting is stored in the Fossil
     repository, so if you make a backup first <i>on the server</i>, you
     can restore the repo file if enabling this feature creates a
     redirect loop.</p>
  #  <p><b>Download, fix, and restore.</b> You can copy the remote
     repository file down to a local machine, use <tt>fossil ui</tt> to
     fix the setting, and then upload it to the repository server
     again.</p>

It's best to enforce TLS-only access at the front-end proxy level
anyway. It not only avoids the problem entirely, it can be significantly
more secure.  The [./tls-nginx.md|nginx TLS proxy guide] shows one way
to achieve this.</p>


<h2>Terminology Note</h2>

This document is called <tt>ssl.wiki</tt> for historical reasons. The
TLS protocol was originally called SSL, and it went through several
revisions before being replaced by TLS. Years before this writing, SSL
finally became entirely obsolete due to weaknesses in the protocol fixed
in the later TLS series of protocols.

Some people still use the term "SSL" when they actually mean "TLS," but
in the Fossil project, we always use "TLS" except when we must preserve
some sort of historical compatibility, as with this document's name in
order to avoid broken external URLs.  The Fossil TLS-related settings
also often use "<tt>ssl</tt>" in their names, for the same reason.

This series of protocols is also called "HTTPS" after the URI scheme
used to specify "HTTP over TLS."
