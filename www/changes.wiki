<title>Change Log</title>

<h2>Changes For Version 1.23 (2012-08-08)</h2>
  *  The default checkout database name is now ".fslckout" instead of
     "_FOSSIL_" on unix.  Both names continue to work.
  *  Added the "fossil all changes" command
  *  Added the "fossil all list --ckout" command
  *  Added the "public-pages" glob pattern that allows anonymous users to
     embedded documentation on sites where source code should not be
     accessible to anonymous users.
  *  Allow multiple --tag options on the same "fossil commit" command.
  *  Change the meaning of the --bgcolor option for "fossil commit" to only
     change the color for that one commit.  The new --branchcolor option 
     is available to set a persistent background color.
  *  Add the branch= query parameter to the vdiff page and the --branch option
     to the "fossil diff" command.
  *  Check-in names of the form "root:BRANCH" now refer to the origin of
     the branch.

  *  Updates against an uncommitted merge are now a warning, not a fatal error.
  *  Prompt the user to continue if a check-in comment is unedited.
  *  Fixes to case sensitivity settings with the /dir webpage.
  *  Repositories now try to remember the locations of all checkouts and
     web-access URLs and display this information with the 
     "fossil info $REPO" command.
  *  Improved defense against spiders:  The src= attribute of
     &lt;a&gt; elements is set using javascript after the page loads.
  *  Enhanced formatting of the user list page.
  *  If a file named in "fossil add" is missing, that is now a warning not
     a fatal error.
  *  Fix side-by-side diff so that it displays correctly with 
     multi-byte UTF8 characters.
  *  Performance improvements in the diff logic.
  *  Lots of other performance tweaks and documentation updates.

<h2>Changes For Version 1.22 (2012-03-17)</h2>
  *  Greatly improved "diff" processing including the new --brief option,
     partial line matching, colorized in-line diffs, and better performance.

  *  Harden the CGI processing logic against DOS attacks
  *  Add the ability to run TH1 scripts after sync requests

     possibly as a relative pathname.

  *  Change the "ssh:" transfer method to allow all access regardless of
     user permission.

  *  Automatically enable hyperlinks if the UserAgent string in the 
     HTTP header suggests that the requestor is a human and not a bot.
  *  Show only commonly used commands with "fossil help".  Use
     "fossil help --all" to see the complete list now.
  *  Improvements to the "stash" command:  (1) Stash all files, not just 
     those below the working directory. (2) Add the --detail option to 
     "list". (3) Confirm before "drop --all". (4) Add the "help" 
     subcommand.
  *  Add an Admin/Access setting to change the number of octets of the
     IP address that are saved in login cookies - allowing this setting
     to be changed to zero
  *  Promote the "test-md5sum" command to "md5sum".
  *  Added the "whatis" command.
