  <h2>Command Line Interface Reference</h2>

  This is an easy introduction to the fossil command line interface
  (cli).  It assumes some familiarity with using the command line, and
  with Source Code Maintenence (SCM) systems&#8212;but not <i>too</i>
  much.

  If you are trying to find information about fossil's web
  capabilities, see the <a href="index.wiki">Fossil Home</a> and
  <a href="wikitheory.wiki">Fossil Wiki</a> pages for pointers.

  <h3>Things to note</h3>
  * Fossil cli commands do not use special delimeters, they use
  spaces.  This is traditional with VCS/SCM.  Some <i>options</i> to
  fossil commands <i>do</i> use special delimiters, particularly the
  '-' (hyphen, or dash) character.  This is very similar to Tcl.
  Think of fossil as a shell you invoke and feed a command to,
  including any options, and it will make more sense.

  * Any fossil command is acceptable once enough of it has been
  entered to make the intent unambiguous.  'clo' is a proper prefix of
  both the 'clone' and 'close' commands, for instance, but 'clon' is
  enough to make the intent&#8212;the 'clone'
  command&#8212;unambiguous.

  * Pragmatically, a [ | <u>version</u>] in <b>fossil</b> is a
  40-character long string of hexadecimal.  <b>fossil</b> will be
  able to figure out which version you want with any
  <i>distinct</i> prefix of that string which is at least four
  characters long.  <em>Commands which require a version are
  looking for the string, a distinct prefix of the string, or a
  <code>tag</code>.</em>

  * SCM in a distributed environment can be a bit confusing with
  regard to branching, merging, and versions in general.  See the
  [./branching.wiki | explanation of branching] and it will all make
  much more sense.

  You should probably start interacting with fossil at the command
  line by asking it what it can
  do:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="tof">&#710;</a>

<b>What follows</b> is a survey of what you get if you type<code>
fossil&nbsp;help&nbsp;<i>command</i> </code>for all of the
commands listed above.  There are links to individual pages for each
of them; pages with content (commands marked with a '*' are done) go
into the reason for a command in a bit more depth than the program help.
<pre>
<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="add">Usage: </a><code><a href="cmd_add.wiki">fossil add</a></code> FILE...
    Make arrangements to add one or more files to the current checkout
    at the next commit.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="all">Usage: </a><code><a href="cmd_all.wiki">fossil all</a></code> (list|pull|push|rebuild|sync)
    The ~/.fossil file records the location of all repositories for a
    user.  This command performs certain operations on all repositories
    that can be useful before or after a period of disconnection operation.
    Available operations are:

    list       Display the location of all repositories

    pull       Run a "pull" operation on all repositories

    push       Run a "push" on all repositories

    rebuild    Rebuild on all repositories

    sync       Run a "sync" on all repositories

    Respositories are automatically added to the set of known repositories
    when one of the following commands against the repository: clone, info,
    pull, push, or sync

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="cgi">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_cgi.wiki">fossil cgi</a> SCRIPT
    The SCRIPT argument is the name of a file that is the CGI script
    that is being run.  The command name, "cgi", may be omitted if
    the GATEWAY_INTERFACE environment variable is set to "CGI" (which
    should always be the case for CGI scripts run by a webserver.)  The
    SCRIPT file should look something like this:

    #!/usr/bin/fossil
    repository: /home/somebody/project.db

    The second line defines the name of the repository.  After locating
    the repository, fossil will generate a webpage on stdout based on
    the values of standard CGI environment variables.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>

    prompted for your GPG passphrase in order to sign the new manifest
    unless the "--nosign" options is used.  All files that have
    changed will be committed unless some subset of files is specified
    on the command line.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="clean">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_clean.wiki">fossil clean</a> ?-all?

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="status">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_status.wiki">fossil status</a>
    Report on the status of the current checkout.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="sync">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_sync.wiki">fossil sync</a> ?URL? ?-R|--repository REPOSITORY?
    Synchronize the local repository with a remote repository.  This is
    the equivalent of running both "push" and "pull" at the same time.
    See the "pull" command for additional information.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="tag">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_tag.wiki">fossil tag</a> SUBCOMMAND ...
    Run various subcommands to control tags and properties

    fossil tag add ?--raw? TAGNAME CHECK-IN ?VALUE?

    Add a new tag or property to CHECK-IN. The tag will
    be usable instead of a CHECK-IN in commands such as
    update and merge.

    fossil tag branch ?--raw? ?--nofork? TAGNAME CHECK-IN ?VALUE?

    A fork will be created so that the new checkin
    is a sibling of CHECK-IN and identical to it except
    for a generated comment. Then the new tag will
    be added to the new checkin and propagated to
    all direct children.  Additionally all symbolic
    tags of that checkin inherited from CHECK-IN will
    be cancelled.

    However, if the option --nofork is given, no
    fork will be created and the tag/property will be
    added to CHECK-IN directly. No tags will be canceled.

    fossil tag cancel ?--raw? TAGNAME CHECK-IN

    Remove the tag TAGNAME from CHECK-IN, and also remove
    the propagation of the tag to any descendants.

    fossil tag find ?--raw? TAGNAME

    List all check-ins that use TAGNAME

    fossil tag list ?--raw? ?CHECK-IN?

    List all tags, or if CHECK-IN is supplied, list
    all tags and their values for CHECK-IN.

    The option --raw allows the manipulation of all types of
    tags used for various internal purposes in fossil. You
    should not use this option to make changes unless you are
    sure what you are doing.

    If you need to use a tagname that might be confused with
    a hexadecimal check-in or artifact ID, you can explicitly
    disambiguate it by prefixing it with "tag:". For instance:

    fossil update decaf

    will be taken as an artifact or check-in ID and fossil will
    probably complain that no such revision was found. However

    fossil update tag:decaf

    will assume that "decaf" is a tag/branch name.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="timeline">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_timeline.wiki">fossil timeline</a> ?WHEN? ?CHECK-IN|DATETIME? ?-n|--count N?
    Print a summary of activity going backwards in date and time
    specified or from the current date and time if no arguments
    are given.  Show as many as N (default 20) check-ins.  The
    WHEN argument can be any unique abbreviation of one of these
    keywords:

    before
    after
    descendants | children
    ancestors | parents

    The CHECK-IN can be any unique prefix of 4 characters or more.
    The DATETIME should be in the ISO8601 format.  For
    examples: "2007-08-18 07:21:21".  You can also say "current"
    for the current version or "now" for the current time.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="undo">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_undo.wiki">fossil undo</a> ?FILENAME...?
    Undo the most recent update or merge operation.  If FILENAME is
    specified then restore the content of the named file(s) but otherwise
    leave the update or merge in effect.

    A single level of undo/redo is supported.  The undo/redo stack
    is cleared by the commit and checkout commands.

<hr><a href="#tof">&#710;</a>
    <a name="update">Usage: </a><a href="cmd_update.wiki">fossil update</a> ?VERSION? ?--latest?
    The optional argument is a version that should become the current
    version.  If the argument is omitted, then use the leaf of the
    tree that begins with the current version, if there is only a    single leaf.  If there are a multiple leaves, the latest is used
    if the --latest flag is present.

    This command is different from the "checkout" in that edits are
    not overwritten.  Edits are merged into the new version.

    <h3>Caveats</h3>
    This is not actually a reference, it's the start of a reference.
    There are wikilinks to uncreated pages for the commands.  This was
    created by running the fossil help for each command listed by running
    fossil help...  Duplicate commands are only listed once (I
    <i>think</i>).  There are several bits of <b>fossil</b> that are not addressed
    in the help for commands (special wiki directories, special users, etc.)
    so they are (currently) not addressed here.  Clarity and brevity may be
    sacrificed for expediency at the authors indiscretion.  All spelling and
    grammatical mistakes are somebody elses fault.<code>  void * </code>
    prohibited where<code> __C_PLUS_PLUS__ </code>. Title and taxes extra.
    Not valid in Hooptigonia.
