There are plenty of open-source version control systems available on the
internet these days. What makes Fossil worthy of attention?

  1.  <b>Bug Tracking And Wiki</b> -
      In addition to doing [./concepts.wiki | distributed version control]
      like Git and Mercurial,
      Fossil also supports [./bugtheory.wiki | distributed bug tracking],
      [./wikitheory.wiki | distributed wiki], and a
      [./event.wiki | distributed blog] mechanism all in a single
      integrated package.

  2.  <b>Web Interface</b> - 
      Fossil has a built-in and easy-to-use [./webui.wiki | web interface]
      that simplifies project tracking and promotes situational awareness.
      Simply type "fossil&nbsp;ui" from within any check-out and Fossil
      automatically opens your web browser in a page that gives detailed
      [/timeline?n=100&y=ci | graphical history] and status information
      on that project.

      This entire website (except the
      [http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html | download] page)
      is just a running instance of Fossil.  The pages you see here
      are all [./wikitheory.wiki | wiki] or
      [./embeddeddoc.wiki | embedded documentation].
      When you clone Fossil from one of its
      [./selfhost.wiki | self-hosting repositories], 
      you get more than just source code - you get this entire website.

  3.  <b>Autosync</b> -
      Fossil supports [./concepts.wiki#workflow | "autosync" mode]
      which helps to keep projects moving
      forward by reducing the amount of needless 
      [./branching.wiki | forking and merging] often
      associated with distributed projects.

  4.  <b>Self-Contained</b> -
      Fossil is a single stand-alone executable that contains everything
      needed to do configuration management.
      Installation is trivial: simply download a 
      <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html">precompiled binary</a>
      for Linux, Mac, or Windows and put it on your $PATH.
      [./build.wiki | Easy-to-compile source code] is available for
      users on other platforms.  Fossil sources are also mostly self-contained,
      requiring only the "zlib" library and the standard C library to build.

  5.  <b>Simple Networking</b> -
      Fossil uses plain old HTTP (with
      [./quickstart.wiki#proxy | proxy support])
      for all network communications, meaning that it works fine from behind
      restrictive firewalls.  The protocol is
      [./stats.wiki | bandwidth efficient] to the point that Fossil can be
      used comfortably over a dial-up internet connection.

  6.  <b>CGI Enabled</b> -
      No server is required to use fossil.  But a
      server does make collaboration easier.  Fossil supports three different
      yet simple [./quickstart.wiki#serversetup | server configurations].
      The most popular is a 2-line CGI script.  This is the approach
      used by the [./selfhost.wiki | self-hosting fossil repositories].

  7.  <b>Robust &amp; Reliable</b> -
      Fossil stores content using an [./fileformat.wiki | enduring file format]
      in an SQLite database so that transactions are
      atomic even if interrupted by a power loss or system crash.  Furthermore,
      automatic [./selfcheck.wiki | self-checks] verify that all aspects of
      the repository are consistent prior to each commit.  In over three years
      of operation, no work has ever been lost after having been committed to
      a Fossil repository.
